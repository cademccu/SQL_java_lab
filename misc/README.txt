The CLASSPATH, compilation and running of the program is done from the bash script file "run.sh"

Feel free to check it out, nothing special, just javac, java.

The XML file is called by the name given on the assignment "Libdata.xml" and should be at the same directory as the java file and the bash compilation file to run. I was planning on giving it as the firstarg, but again, time.

TO RUN (from terminal):


chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
