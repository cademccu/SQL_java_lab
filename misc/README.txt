The CLASSPATH, compilation and running of the program is done from the bash script file "run.sh"

Feel free to check it out, nothing special, just javac, java.

The XML file is called by the name given on the assignment "Libdata.xml" and should be at the same directory as the java file and the bash compilation file to run. I was planning on giving it as the firstarg, but again, time.

TO RUN (from terminal):


chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh


# NOTES

I did not get to checking whether a books total copies would be exceeded by checking a book in. Therefore, a book could have 5 copies, 5 copies available and my code would (probably) still check it in and increment the copies avaible. Not sure this situation occured, but I know how to fix it and where, just don't have time due to i'm an idiot for not starting this earlier.

Additionally, I did not finish the last query of #5. Again, time. Didn't see a late period so I want to get this in before the deadline.

Really underestimated the length of this....


Anyways, thank you!
